# OSI model
- Not all networks implemented using this exactly but good model
- *media layers*: physical, datalink, network
  - deals with how data moves b/t pA & pB
- *host layers*: transport, session, presentation, application
  - how data is serialized & transported and how it is parsed

Layer X devices
- has capabilities for that layer and layers below
- higher layers build on lower layers to add functionality & capabilities
- layers are independent
  - e.g. web browser (layer 7 device) talks to web server (another layer 7 device) directly, even though they're using lower levels
  - lower levels are abstracted

# Layer 1: Physical
- provides timing, voltages levels, etc, and defines connectors
- medium: wire, RF, light
- multicasting: anything received on port is transmitted to other ports
  - no device addressing
- *hub*: layer 1 device. Repeats activity from 1 port to other ports
- collision: only one device can comm at a time, otherwise signals collide and corrupt data
  - cannot detect collisions
- *1 broadcast & 1 collision domain*
  - means it doesn't scale well
- not intelligent; layer 2 provides intelligence
- limitations
  - only multicasting
  - collision detection not handled

# Layer 2: Data Link
- provides device to device comm.
- *MAC (Media Access Control) address*: globally unique, assigned to physical device (not sw-assigned)
  - 2 parts
    - OUI (organizationally unique id): assigned to manufacturer
    - NIC (network interface controller)
- *frames*: container
  - preamble: start of frame
  - MAC header
    - dest & src MAC addr's
      - broadcast = all F's in dest
    - ET (Ethertype): which layer 3 protocol, e.g. IP
      - layer 3 uses layer 2 to put data in frame
  - payload
    - *encapsulation*: payload is encapsulated before transmission.
      - layer 3 generates (e.g. IP packet) and is put in a layer 2 ethernet frame
      - every layer encapsulates, and is de-encapsulated as it moves up the layers
  - *FCS (Frame check sequence)*: CRC error check
- *Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)*
  - CSMA: detect if any signal on layer 1 before passing frame
    - if carrier is detected, wait until free before passing frame
  - CD: if collision detected, jam signal sent by all devices detecting, then random back-off occurs
    - back-off: no transmission attempted
      - if successful, one device transmits, other devices detect carrier and wait
      - fail, back-off period is increased
- hub - layer 1 device, collisions can still occur
- *switch* - layer 2 device
  - works like a hub
  - understands frames & mac addr's
  - maintains mac addr table
    - learns mac addr's conn'd to each port
  - stores & forwards frames
    - only forwards frame to destination
    - collisions limited to one port
      - switch only fwds valid frames
      - deals w/ frames, not layer 1
    - *N port switch has N collision domains*
- foundation for all networks
- allow unicast (1:1) & broadcast (1:all) comm.
- limitations
  - networks are isolated

# Layer 3: Network
- layer 2 networks can only be conn'd with direct point to point links
  - must be same L2 protocol
    - ethernet: most popular L2 protocol
    - for long-dist, may use PPP, MPLS, ATM
- IP (Internet Protocol)
  - cross-network IP Addressing
  - routing
  - don't need direct P2P links
  - IP packet is encap'd for local network, then as it moves to other networks, de-encap'd and encap'd again for local network
  - v4 & v6
  - v4 struct
    - src/dest ip addr
    - protocol: Layer 4 protocol (e.g. ICMP, TCP, UDP)
    - data: from L4
    - TTL (time to live): how many hops the packets can move thru, stops packets from looping forever
  - v6:
    - src/dest are larger
    - hop limit: like ttl
- *packet*
  - like frames
  - in frames, src/dest are local, but in packets they can be anywhere
  - in transit, the packets remain the same (mostly), but encap'd in frames
- *IPv4*
  - example: 133.33.3.7
    - dotted-decimal snotation
    - 32 bits
  - IP network part: first 2 octets (133.33)
  - host part: last 2 octets(3.7)
  - assigned statically or by program
    - DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuraton Protocol)
  - Default Gateway: local network IP address where packets fwded if dest is remote ip
    - use subnet mask to det. local or remote dest
      - remote: sent to Default Gateway (usually router)
      - e.g. 255.255.0.0 = /16 prefix (# of 1's in subnet mask starting from left: 11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000)
- Routes & Route tables
  - *Route*: where to fwd packet
  - example: home request through ISP to AWS
  - /32: most specific route (only 1 IP address)
  - /0: least specific (all addr's)
  - 0.0.0.0/0: default route. Match if nothing else does
  - *Route Table*: contain multiple routes
    - ISP has multiple NIC cards. 1+ Route Tables per router
    - table format: dest. IP mapped to next hop / target
    - statically populated or BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
  - ISP router fwding to AWS router - happens on layer 2
    - packet has mac addr of aws router
    - *Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)*: find mac addr of ip addr
      - is on L2. Broadcasts to all IP's on local network to find who has the dest addr.
      - remote dest IP: ARP will get the local router's mac addr, encapsulates in frame
        - when router gets frame, it will see the mac address is for it. Usually if the packet is not for it, a device will drop it, but the router is different and takes it to fwd to next device
- *router*: L3 device
  - move from src to dest, and encapsulates packet in L2 on the way
- L3 provides D2D comm over internet
- limitations
  - L3 doesn't provide individ. chan's of comm.
    - only src/dest ip's; can't handle comm for mult. apps on same device
    - delivery order not guaranteed

# Layer 4: Transport
- could include L5. OSI is conceptual model
- L4 limitations - every packet independent/isolated
  - packets could arrive out of order
  - packets could be lost (network issue, exceed TTL)
  - different packets can have different delays
  - no channels of comm (support mult. apps), only src/dest IP (D2D comm)
  - no flow control: if src tx's faster than dest rx's, can result in packet loss
- L4 adds TCP & UDP
  - TCP: slower, reliable
    - for reliability, error correction, reliable order
    - connection-oriented: need to set up conn. b/t devices
  - UDP: faster, less reliable
- TCP
  - segments: container
